# My_NISR_dashboard
We chose these data because we are familiar with them.
In addition, during our analysis, we checked their relevance to the labor force.
We also decided on this interaction because it provides a wealth of information and is essential according to preferences, such as gender. 
Before making our choice, we were beginners with both Python and R programming.
Ultimately, we chose Streamlit because it is more widely used than R and produces better visuals than R programming.
We needed to be proficient in Python for our project, and we selected specific colors to highlight differences in our data.
We experimented to find colors that looked better than others
In creating this dashboard, we initially gathered data from the NISR website, specifically focusing on the second topic, the Labour Force Survey. The data was extracted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. A new sheet, named 'new,' was created to compile the necessary information for building the dashboard.

Following this, we utilized Visual Studio Code and Streamlit for dashboard development. The Excel file was imported, and we selected columns such as 'Total, Male, Female, Urban, Rural, Participated in Subsistence Agriculture, Not Participated in Subsistence Agriculture' to form the basis of our dashboard. An additional layer of interactivity was introduced, allowing users to dynamically alter the displayed data by selecting different categories and subcategories.

The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into the labor force, including percentages of individuals engaged and not engaged in the workforce, employment and unemployment statistics, age distribution within the labor force, and a breakdown between formal and informal employment. Notably, all graphs within the dashboard are designed to adapt to changes in the selected parameters, offering a holistic view of the data for users with varying informational needs.
